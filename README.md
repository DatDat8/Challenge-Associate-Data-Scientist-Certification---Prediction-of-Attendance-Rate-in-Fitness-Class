This is the challenge I faced in the exam for the certificate of Associate Data Scientist in DataCamp. It was the application in the combination of my skills including Data Validation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Fitting and Model Evaluation, which I have grasped from my personal projets and also which I have learnt from the courses in DataCamp aiming to pursue my desired Data Science domain.

--------- TASK DESCRIPTION -------------

## Company Background
GoalZone is a fitness club chain providing five types of fitness classes in Canada. Finally, the fitness classes schedule is back to normal after the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. However, they have received many complaints from the customers about having a hard time booking a fitness class.

From initial analysis, the program operation team found out that the fitness classes are always fully booked but are having a low attendance rate per class. To improve this situation, they would like to increase the class capacity for customers to sign up if a low attendance rate is predicted.  


## Customer Question
The operation manager has asked you to answer the following:
- Can you predict the attendance rate for each fitness class?
